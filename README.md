# Drum-Kit
This program allows users to click the on screen buttons (or use the keyboard) to produce sounds from a typical drum set. 

Created this project as part of a udemy course. 

This is a web-based "Drum Kit" application:

HTML: Features a set of buttons representing different drum sounds, each labeled with a character (e.g., 'w', 'a', 's').

CSS: Styles the webpage with a dark background, gives each drum button a specific drum image as its background, and provides visual effects, like a pressed state for active buttons.

JavaScript: Enables interactivity by playing corresponding drum sounds when a button is clicked or when a specific key (matching a drum button) is pressed on the keyboard. The button briefly animates to indicate it's been activated.
